**Select All Matching Strings with ALT+SHIFT+.**: A Handy Visual Studio Shortcut

Visual Studio just made editing repetitive code faster with a new shortcut: **ALT+SHIFT+.** Now, you can select all instances of the same string or variable in one go. Here's why this feature rocks:

1. **Quick Edits Across Multiple Matches**  
   This shortcut lets you instantly highlight all instances of the same text, so you can make changes everywhere at onceâ€”no more hunting down every occurrence or risking missed spots.

2. **Perfect for Refactoring and Consistency**  
   Whether you're renaming variables, updating function names, or changing string values, ALT+SHIFT+. makes it simple to apply edits uniformly, helping you keep your codebase clean and consistent.

3. **Saves Time and Boosts Workflow**  
   Instead of switching to a search-and-replace, this shortcut keeps you in the editing flow, making it perfect for quick, on-the-spot changes that won't slow you down.

The ALT+SHIFT+. shortcut is a small but powerful addition, helping you edit faster and more efficiently!
