Visual Studio Code is bringing in the big AI guns, adding support for Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, and OpenAI's o1-preview. Here's why that's huge:

1. **Powerful AI Lineup**  
   With Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI's latest models onboard, VS Code is catching up to Cursor with an AI toolbox that can help with everything from auto-completing code to offering smart refactors and code explanations. It's like having three coding sidekicks in one IDE.

2. **Keeping Pace with Cursor**  
   This update lets VS Code users get the same cutting-edge AI benefits that Cursor users have been raving about, but with no need to switch editors.
