# Snapshots in Azure Data Studio

## Overview
[DbSnapshotCreator](https://github.com/ecirpnaes/DbSnapshotCreator) is a valuable extension for Azure Data Studio that simplifies the process of creating, managing, and reverting database snapshots. Database snapshots provide a read-only, static view of a database at a specific point in time. This can be incredibly useful for scenarios like testing, auditing, and quickly restoring databases to a previous state without the need for full backups.
