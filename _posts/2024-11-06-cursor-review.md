Cursor is a code editor built around AI, designed to boost your productivity without getting in your way. Here's why you should give it a spin:

## Key Features

   Cursor supports advanced AI models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude, to help you write code faster, suggest fixes, refactor code, and even explain tricky snippets.

2. **Easy Migration from VS Code**  
   Built as a fork of Visual Studio Code, Cursor lets you import all your favorite themes and extensions, so switching over is practically seamless.
