Visual Studio just added a long-awaited feature to its debugger: **inline return values for return statements**.

Here's why this small change is a big win for devs:

1. **Instant Insight at Return Points**  
   Now, when you step through your code, the debugger will show the values returned by functions directly next to each return statement. No more hunting through watch windows or waiting until the next line to see return valuesâ€”you'll get them right where they happen.
