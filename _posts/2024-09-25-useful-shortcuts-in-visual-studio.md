Enhancing productivity in Visual Studio can significantly improve your coding efficiency. Here are some of my favorite tips and shortcuts that have made a noticeable difference in my daily workflow.

## Minimize and Maximize All Methods in a Class

Working with large classes can be challenging, especially when they span thousands of lines. Visual Studio provides a handy shortcut to collapse or expand all methods within a class, allowing you to focus on specific sections without distraction.

**Shortcut:**

- **Collapse All Methods:** `Ctrl + M, O`
- **Expand All Methods:** `Ctrl + M, P`

Using these shortcuts, you can quickly navigate through your code, making it easier to manage and understand large codebases.

*This is particularly useful when dealing with classes exceeding 30,000 lines, enabling a cleaner view of your code structure.*

## Move a Code Line Up or Down

Often, you might need to rearrange lines of code to improve logic flow or readability. Instead of cutting and pasting, Visual Studio offers a shortcut to move lines up or down seamlessly.

**Shortcut:**

- **Move Line Up:** `Alt + Up Arrow`
- **Move Line Down:** `Alt + Down Arrow`

This feature enhances coding efficiency by allowing you to adjust code positioning without disrupting your typing flow.

*I wasn't aware of this shortcut before, but it's faster and more intuitive than the traditional cut and paste method when rearranging code.*
